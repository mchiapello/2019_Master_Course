please try to schedule appointments as far in advance as possible. In general it
will be very difficult to set up appointments less than 24 hours in advance.*

### Required Texts

There is no required text book for this class.

All needed material is openly available on the course website. If you are
interested in additional reading on the topics we are covering I highly
recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is freely
available on the web.


### Course Description

Computers are increasingly essential to the study of all aspects of
biology. Data management skills are needed for entering data without errors,
storing it in a usable way, and extracting key aspects of the data for
analysis. Basic programming is required for everything from accessing and
managing data, to statistical analysis, to modeling. This course will provide an
introduction to data management, manipulation, and analysis, with an emphasis on
biological problems. Class will typically consist of short introductions or
question & answer sessions, followed by hands on computing exercises. The course
will be taught using R and SQLite, but the concepts learned will easily apply to
all programming languages and database management systems. No background in
programming or databases is required.


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic biology.


### Purpose of Course

In this course you will learn all of the fundamental aspects of computer
programming that are necessary for conducting biological research. By the end of
the course you will be able to use these tools to import data into R, perform
analysis on that data, and export the results to graphs, text files, and
databases. By learning how to get the computer to do your work for you, you will
be able to do more science faster.


### Course Objectives and Goals

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Create well structured databases
* Extract information from databases
* Write simple computer programs in R
* Automate data analysis
* Apply these tools to address biological questions
* Apply general data management and analysis concepts to other programming
  languages and database management systems


### How this course relates to the Student Learning Outcomes in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation

This course contributes to the 'Quantitative Skills' and 'Conducting and
Analyzing Independent/Original Research' Student Learning Outcomes specified in
the
[Ph.D. and MS in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Academic Assessment Plans](http://assessment.aa.ufl.edu/Data/Sites/22/media/2013-14gaap/cals/2013-14-cals-wildlife-ecol-and-consvn-phd-aap.pdf),
by providing students the skills and knowledge they need to manage and analyze
the data used in research.


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered, approach, because
learning to program and work with data requires actively working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I think they
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in
knowing more take a look at this great
[info-graphic](https://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom-2/).


### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Classes will
involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve. For more challenging topics class may start with 20-30
minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.


## Course Policies


### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class struggle to learn the
material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.


### Attendance policy

Attendance is not required but it is recommended that you attend class as often as
possible to get the most out of the course.


### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for
the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension.
However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when
possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up
if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted.
Assignments turned in after the 48 hour grace period without an extension will be
be graded with a 20% penalty.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Eastern Time. Assignments should be
submitted via Canvas. This allows you to be finished with one week's material
before starting the next week's material.


### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops (see [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup)
for installation instructions). Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


### Materials and Supplies Fees

There are no materials and supplies fees for this course.


## UF Policies


### University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with
the Disability Resource Center (352-392-8565; http://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/) by
providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students will receive an
accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting
accommodation. Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early
as possible in the semester. 

My policy: If you are in my class I want to help learn and will happily work
with you to make the learning environment equitable for you and others.


### University on Course Evaluations

Students are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this
course by completing online evaluations at https://evaluations.ufl.edu.
Evaluations are typically open during the last two or three weeks of the
semester, but students will be given specific times when they are open. Summary
results of these assessments are available to students at
https://evaluations.ufl.edu/results/.


### University Policy on Academic Misconduct

Academic honesty and integrity are fundamental values of the University
community. Students should be sure that they understand the UF Student Honor
Code at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/students.php.


### Netiquette and Communication Courtesy

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common
courtesy in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.


### University Honesty Policy

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, “We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.” The Honor Code (https://www.dso.ufl.edu/sccr/process/student-conduct-honor-code/) specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with the instructor or TAs in this class.


### Software Use

All faculty, staff, and students of the University are required and expected to
obey the laws and legal agreements governing software use.  Failure to do so can
lead to monetary damages and/or criminal penalties for the individual violator.
Because such violations are also against University policies and rules,
disciplinary action will be taken as appropriate.  We, the members of the
University of Florida community, pledge to uphold ourselves and our peers to the
highest standards of honesty and integrity.


### Student Privacy

There are federal laws protecting your privacy with regards to grades earned in
courses and on individual assignments.  For more information, please see:
http://registrar.ufl.edu/catalog0910/policies/regulationferpa.html
