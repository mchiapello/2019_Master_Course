# Code of Conduct

## Part 1. Introduction 

I value the involvement of everyone in the class. I am committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in this class are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in this course is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed during the course including, but not limited to, class, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Students are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.  

The teacher is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. It can be contacted by emailing [chiapello.m@gmail.com](mailto:chiapello.m@gmail.com). 
All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential. 
 
## Part 2. The Code of Conduct

The teacher is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level. 

Everyone who participates in this course is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to, class, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Students are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the teacher resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information. 

### Part 2.1 Expected behaviour

All students are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment I encourage the following kinds of behaviours:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members


### Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by students include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group  
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation  
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images  
- unwelcome sexual attention  
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact  
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs  
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm  
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop  
- publication of private communication without consent  

### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Students who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a student engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the teacher may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage the Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
